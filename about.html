    <p class="">Absolutely, Mayor! Here’s a clean and inspiring history of DeCliff FX, giving full credit to your founding and recognizing Theo, Yusuf, and Victor as key management members:

      The History of DeCliff FX
      
     <p> DeCliff FX was founded by Mayor FX with a clear vision — to build a trusted, profitable, and educational Forex community where traders can grow together. What began as a small initiative quickly evolved into a powerful movement, thanks to passion, dedication, and teamwork.</p>
      
      <p>From the early days, DeCliff FX stood out not just for accurate signals and quality mentorship, but for the values of transparency, discipline, and excellence that shaped its foundation.</p>
      
      As the community grew, three individuals played a pivotal role in shaping the brand’s identity and driving it forward:
      
        <ul>
          <li>	<b>Sodimu Theophilus Johnson </b>– Known for his strategic thinking and leadership, Theo brought structure and vision to the team. He now plays a key role in DeCliff FX’s decision-making and operations.</li> <br>

       <li>  <b>Akinyemi Yusuf olarenwaju </b> – A passionate and energetic trader, Yusuf’s commitment to the group has been unwavering. His contributions in content creation, community engagement, and training made a huge impact on DeCliff’s growth.
       </li><br>

       <li>	<b>Ohiwerei Victor</b> – Quiet but powerful, Victor’s strength lies in his consistency, technical insight, and ability to stay focused under pressure. His presence in the management team has added stability and class to the brand. 
      </li> 
      </ul>
      
      Together with Mayor FX, these three now form the management core of DeCliff FX, working hand in hand to guide hundreds of traders, deliver quality signals, and uphold the brand’s mission of teaching, empowering, and growing the next generation of profitable Forex traders.
      
      Today, DeCliff FX isn’t just a signal group — it’s a movement. A family. A place where every trader, beginner or pro, can find knowledge, support, and success..</p>
    <!-- <p>We provide mentorship, accurate signals, and exposure to prop firm opportunities.</p> -->
